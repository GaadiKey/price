Taking a car delivery happens once/twice in a lifetime and of course it is a happy lifetime moment for you and your family. While the day seem to be quite exciting, you should never forget to perform PDI on your car coming up with some excuses. Although you may very well trust and believe the words of sales team who sold this car, you have to indepently verify things yourselves by doing PDI without fail.
